# t-shirt20

This project is an old playground for generating SVG images for Meeting C++ t-shirts. The code is not always written with this goal in mind, not to be cutting edge nice to use production code.

The original code fills a 2d space with a Penrose Tiling, and uses C++14.

For Meeting C++ 2020 the t-shirt will have a different pattern. I plan to use C++17 where it makes sense, and a conversion to C++20 might be a nice project for later.
